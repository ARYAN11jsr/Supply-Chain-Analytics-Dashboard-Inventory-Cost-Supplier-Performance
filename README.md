# Supply-Chain-Analytics-Dashboard-Inventory-Cost-Supplier-Performance
This project focuses on analyzing end-to-end supply chain operations to uncover inventory inefficiencies, supplier delivery risks, and procurement cost drivers. Using Excel, SQL, and Power BI, the project converts raw operational data into interactive dashboards for data-driven decision making.
The analysis covers 900 SKUs across 5 warehouses with a total inventory value of 1.26M, applying ABC classification to identify high-value and high-risk stock. Procurement data totaling 1.60M was analyzed to flag 193 high-value SKUs and 835 overstock-risk SKUs contributing to excess holding costs.

Supplier performance was evaluated by comparing actual vs expected lead times, revealing an average lead time gap of 25.33 days and 89.04K units stuck in transit, highlighting major delivery and stock blockage risks.
